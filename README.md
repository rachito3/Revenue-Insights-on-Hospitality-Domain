# Atliq Hardwares Sales Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview
Atliq Hardwares is a computer hardware business facing challenges in increasing revenue within a dynamically changing market. To address these challenges, the sales director requires a dashboard that offers real-time insights into sales performance, enabling data-driven decisions to boost revenue.

## Problem Statement
The company is struggling with identifying actionable insights due to a lack of real-time data visualization, making it difficult to adapt to market changes and drive revenue growth.

## Solution
As a data analyst, I developed a comprehensive dashboard using SQL for data extraction and transformation and Power BI for data visualization. The dashboard provides:

- **Revenue Growth Tracking:** Displays revenue trends over time, highlighting growth patterns and anomalies.
- **Year-Over-Year (YOY) Trends:** Compares current sales performance with previous periods to identify growth or decline.
- **Region-Wise Sales Performance:** Breaks down sales data by region, allowing for targeted analysis and strategy development.

## Results
The implementation of this dashboard has equipped the sales director and other stakeholders with critical, real-time insights into the company's sales performance. These insights facilitate informed decision-making, optimizing product offerings, customer prioritization, and overall sales strategies. The dashboard's actionable data is projected to potentially increase the company's revenue by at least 7% in the next quarter.
